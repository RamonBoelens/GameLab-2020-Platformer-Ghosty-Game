  instruction: Doing what you can do as a manager to lessen the stress on individuals
    and groups under your supervision is likely to reduce ethnic and cultural tensions
    as well, even if the stress is unrelated to cultural issues.
  bck_Answer: True. Under stress individuals tend to revert to their earliest learned
    values and surival behaviors. Their tolerance for people different from them
    is reduced and they are often likely to accuse or blame these people for the
    discomfort they are currently experiencing.
  bck_FollowUp: If you chose the better answer, keep this card. If not, discard it.
